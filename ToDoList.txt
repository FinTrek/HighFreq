# ToDo list for package HighFreq: high frequency data scrubbing

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html
R CMD INSTALL HighFreq
or
install.packages("C:/Develop/R/HighFreq", repos=NULL, type="source")

# create package vignette from *.Rd files
R CMD Rd2pdf HighFreq

### comments
Calculating returns on 1-second bars doesn't make sense for two reasons: 
First, because the changes in price are very small, comparable to the precision of prices (number of significant digits).
As a result, price changes on 1-second bars are either zero or low multiples of the precision. 
Second, the 1-second bar prices bounce randomly between static bid and ask prices (the bid-ask bounce).  
Therefore 1-second bar returns carry almost no information.


### tasks pending

- [ ] add wiki  

- [ ] apply Hampel Filter to scrub data

- [ ] run on travis, add .travis.yml file, add Build Status tag to README.Rmd

- [ ] add vignette and automatically build vignette  

- [ ] create /tests directory and use testthat

- [x] create project website for HighFreq on GitHub Pages using R Markdown  

- [x] rename README.md to .Rmd and add more detailed description similar this to README.md:  
https://github.com/RcppCore/rcpp-gallery/blob/gh-pages/src/2016-05-27-HRP.Rmd
use rmarkdown templates

https://github.com/hrbrmstr/markdowntemplates
http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/02/svm-r-markdown-manuscript/

- [ ] modify function skew_ohlc() to accomodate case when open price isn't equal to previous close price.  
add argument "open_to_close" with default value TRUE  

- [ ] create function roll_hurst() for rolling Hurst exponent, similar to roll_sum()  
use HurstIndex() from PerformanceAnalytics?
HurstIndex() is wrong because it uses range of returns, instead of range of cumulative returns!
apply log()
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detrended_fluctuation_analysis
Detrended fluctuation analysis - is it like variance ratios?

- [ ] create volume-weighted Hurst and density plots  
https://quantivity.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/volume-clock-gaps-and-goog/

- [ ] prove that OHLC skew formula is an estimator of skew  
Do Garman-Klass and Rogers-Satchell estimators work for processes that are not Gaussian?  
perform simulation to find out  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-hitting-time_model  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process  

- [ ] analyze paper: Shen Skew Kurtosis Stock Premiums Forecasting.pdf

- [ ] aggregate data to 10-second bars (?)  

- [ ] convert function season_ality() to use split.xts() (?)  

- [ ] create function open_close() to remove close-to-open jumps from OHLC (?)  

- [ ] replace caTools with TTR functions (?)  
only runquantile() is called from caTools  
but not easy to replace runquantile(), because no equivalent TTR function  
would require rewriting extreme_values() and price_jumps(), and then benchmarking  

- [ ] move roll_sum() to rutils (?)

- [ ] use .subset_xts() (?)

- [ ] rename save_rets_OHLC to rets_OHLC (?)  

add logical arg as option to aggregate data or not

calculate rets from scrubbed data

calculate statistics (moments, quantiles) on tick and OHLC data and save them in files

create function to estimate beta from HFreq data

create function to forecast skewness
Show that variance is predictable over time 
Show that skewness is not predictable over time (Harvey and Siddique, 1999), 
so variables other than lagged skewness are required to forecast skewness.
Show that idiosyncratic volatility is a strong predictor of idiosyncratic skewness.

study time dependence of mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis
show that skewness and kurtosis decay with time



calculate tail shape of return frequency distribution and demonstrate power law


analyze code in functions:
	rmOutliers
	loadInstruments
	getSymbols.FI - done


adopt .Rdata file and directory conventions

analyze code in:
	scripts_hist.R - done
	Rhistory 07-12-14.txt - done
	copy anything useful and then delete files - done


### tasks finished

- [x] perform bootstrap estimation of standard errors for all the methods in function vari_ance()  
benchmark to random OHLC

- [x] add to function vari_ance() the methods "garman.klass_yz" and "yang.zhang"  

- [x] modify functions vari_ance() to accomodate case when open price isn't equal to previous close price - methods "garman.klass_yz" and "yang.zhang"  

- [x] rename function vol_ohlc() to vari_ance()

- [x] create function to_period()  

- [x] rename argument agg_fun to esti_mator, in functions agg_regate() and roll_agg()  

- [x] remove calc_method argument from agg_regate() and roll_agg() - instead use "..." argument

- [x] rename agg_ohlc and roll_agg_ohlc() to agg_regate() and roll_agg()  

- [x] dereference all external functions using "::", i.e. rutils::na_me()

- [x] add @export to roxygen code  

- [x] convert all code from nrow() and ncol() to NROW() and NCOL()  

- [x] replace strsplit(colnames(ohlc)[1], split="[.]")[[1]][1] with rutils::na_me(ohlc)  

- [x] fix roxygen .Rd documentation file building error - name at end of hf_data.R file was wrong - should be the names of objects, i.e. "SPY", "sym_bol", not the file name  

- [x] create data documention  

- [x] rename moment_ohlc() and roll_moment_ohlc() to agg_ohlc and roll_agg_ohlc()
mom_fun to agg_fun

- [x] create function hurst_ohlc() for calculating Hurst exponent from OHLC data
OHLC data naturally lends itself to Hurst analysis: ratio of (H-L)/(C-O)

- [x] in moment_ohlc() and roll_moment_ohlc() removed log of ohlc
moment_ohlc() and roll_moment_ohlc() should pass ohlc to skew_ohlc() and vol_ohlc(), etc., not log ohlc

- [x] modify skew_ohlc() and vol_ohlc() to accept ohlc, not log ohlc, and to apply log internally

- [x] include rutil package 

- [x] create function for performing daily, weekly, and monthly seasonality aggregations

- [x] rename functions run_*() to roll_*()

- [x] rename save_OHLC() to save_scrub_agg()

- [x] in save_rets_OHLC() update documentation

- [x] in save_OHLC() combine sapply loops into one

- [x] in save_OHLC() and save_rets() pass scrub params to scrub_agg

- [x] add timezone to argument list

- [x] create function save_TAQ()
	saves scrubbed TAQ and/or OHLC data in daily files
	similar to save_OHLC, but doesn't aggregate and saves into multiple files

- [x] create function calc_rets()
	calculate returns of time series

created function save_rets() (similar to save_OHLC): 
	scrub and aggregate data, calculate returns, and save them

created function save_rets_OHLC()
	similar to save_rets, but assumes clean OHLC input data
	- no scrubbing or aggregation


### tasks deprecated

- [ ] calculate volume-weighted moments and compare them to standard moments
add volume-weighting to vol_ohlc() and skew_ohlc()
