\title{Calculate a time series of \emph{Hurst} exponents over a rolling lookback
window.}
\usage{
roll_hurst(oh_lc, win_dow = 11)
}
\arguments{
\item{oh_lc}{an \emph{OHLC} time series of prices in \emph{xts} format.}

\item{win_dow}{the size of the lookback window, equal to the number of bars
of data used for aggregating the \emph{OHLC} prices.}
}
\value{
An \emph{xts} time series with a single column and the same number of
  rows as the argument \code{oh_lc}.
}
\description{
Calculate a time series of \emph{Hurst} exponents over a rolling lookback
window.
}
\details{
The function \code{roll_hurst()} calculates a time series of
  \emph{Hurst} exponents from \emph{OHLC} prices, over a rolling lookback
  window.
  
  The \emph{Hurst} exponent is defined as the logarithm of the ratio of the
  price range, divided by the standard deviation of returns, and divided by
  the logarithm of the window length.
  
  The function \code{roll_hurst()} doesn't use the same definition as the 
  rescaled range definition of the \emph{Hurst} exponent.
  First, because the price range is calculated using \emph{High} and 
  \emph{Low} prices, which produces bigger range values, and higher
  \emph{Hurst} exponent estimates.
  Second, because the \emph{Hurst} exponent is estimated using a single
  aggregation window, instead of multiple windows in the rescaled range
  definition.
  
  The rationale for using a different definition of the \emph{Hurst} exponent
  is that it's designed to be a technical indicator for use as input into
  trading models, rather than an estimator for statistical analysis.
